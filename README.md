# RaceResults

I created this app as a company app to Forza Motorsport 7. With it you can keep track of the points you earned each round of the tournement, which car you have driven and how the others competed with you.

It is built using:
* `react-native`
* `expo`
* `TypeScript`
* `redux`
* `react-native-paper`
* `react-navigation`
* `react-native-testing-library`
